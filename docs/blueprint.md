## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Bright Yellow (#FFDA63) to capture the Neo-Brutalism aesthetic with a vibrant and attention-grabbing base. High saturation suggests the bold nature of the request.
- Background color: Pale Yellow (#FAF0D7), providing a subtle and soft background that doesn't distract from the content.
- Accent color: Light Orange (#FFB347), an analogous hue used for interactive elements, providing visibility and a warm, complementary contrast.
- Headline font: 'Impact' for large, bold typography.
- Body font: 'PT Sans' for readability in smaller text.
- Use bold and cartoonish icons, fitting the raw and playful theme. The visual style is influenced by vector-based hand-drawn graphics.
- Employ a grid-breaking layout with uneven placements, creating an intentional imperfect feel, referencing Neo-Brutalism.
- Integrate subtle motion illusions using parallax, overlapping layers, and liquify hover effects, implementing illusion and isometric depth.
