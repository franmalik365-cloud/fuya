    tools: ['Figma', 'Notion', 'FigJam'],
    problemStatement: 'ProPeers is a platform for dreamers and tech enthusiasts to connect, but user retention was low despite a strong concept. The problem wasn’t in the features but in the visual and interaction design — users came, explored, and left. Key pain points included a weak visual hierarchy, underutilized features due to poor usability, and no emotional connection to keep users engaged.',
    goals: [
      'Redesign major user flows with a focus on emotional connection.',
      'Create a visual identity aligned with the brand.',
      'Increase usability, engagement, and retention.',
      'Introduce innovative features to differentiate the platform.'
    ],
    research: 'As an active ProPeers user for 1 year, I conducted heuristic evaluation and user journey mapping. Key insights revealed that the visual design didn’t reflect the platform’s community-driven purpose, users found the app "functional but forgettable," and a lack of micro-interactions reduced emotional stickiness.',
    designProcess: [
      'Adopted an Observation → Redesign → Innovation approach.',
      'Defined a brand-inspired color system to move beyond plain white.',
      'Established a strong grid system for scalable consistency.',
      'Integrated micro-interactions for engagement (hover states, transitions).',
      'Designed an AI Roadmap feature with a custom UI to give ProPeers a unique advantage.'
    ],
    finalSolution: 'Redesigned key modules to improve usability and flow, including the Home Page, Notifications, Search, Chat, and Profile Page. A bonus feature, the AI Roadmap, was introduced to provide a personalized, AI-powered career/growth roadmap. Improvements focused on brand-inspired colors, emotional UX, clear information flow, and new UX features to drive engagement.',
    impact: [
      'Higher potential retention by directly targeting usability issues.',
      'Boosted emotional connection through a visual system aligned with brand psychology.',
      'Increased feature engagement in chat, roadmap, and product sections.',
      'Positioned ProPeers as a community-first, innovation-driven app.'
    ],
    learnings: 'Emotional UX is as critical as features for community-driven platforms. The next steps involve A/B testing the redesigned flows with live users and expanding the AI Roadmap into a scalable product offering.',
